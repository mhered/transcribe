00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,400
Hello, thank you for having the English track which I can present because my Spanish, if

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,120
you have spoken to me before, then you know it's not good. Hopefully next year I can give

3
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,320
a talk in Spanish maybe. Anyway, thank you so much for coming as well to listen to this

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,520
talk instead of other amazing talk. First of all, this is the slides and my Twitter handle

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,560
and stuff. I love people tweet about me, so please. If you love tweeting things, we are

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:02,520
a perfect match so you can tweet about me. So, yeah. So for those of you here, so do

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,280
you come here because you have been to a sprint, you know what is a sprint or you have no idea,

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,600
you just come here just to see what I'm going to talk about. So who have attended the sprint?

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,920
So, oh, there's a few of you. So you know what a sprint is, which is great. But before

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,720
I dive into the talk, I would like to introduce you to a different type of sprint. So, oh,

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,720
the picture is not loading. So, okay. I would basically, I don't know why the picture is

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,080
not loading, but maybe because it needs to be on. Anyway, this one actually you can find

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:44,320
the picture on my Twitter. So I was holding an ice cream on the street of Granada. So

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:52,480
I was having a Granada ice cream in Granada. So it's actually a joke that I sometimes,

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,680
you know, during a conference, I would, you know, type in the channel saying I'm going

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,400
for an ice cream sprint who's coming with me and like sometimes people come with me,

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,640
they thought it's a sprint at the conference. So they were like, oh, I've heard good things

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,640
about the sprint and join me and they end up eating an ice cream. So that's what I sometimes

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:19,000
do. So I'm checked. Oh, this is loading. Good. Okay. So hello, I'm checked. And I work in

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,840
a lot of open source project. I love open source project. I think open source project

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:31,400
are important. And also I, yeah, so I also organize a lot of conference. I also organize

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,680
something called pattern sprints in the past. It's not coming back after the pandemic yet

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,840
because I was too busy. But anyway, so this is all the conference that I've been involved

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,480
in the past. Also I stream a little bit on Twitch during the pandemic because I was having

25
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,960
too much time at hand. So that's what I did. So what is the sprint that we got to talk

26
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,920
about now? It's not the sport. For those of you who are very athletic and love running,

27
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,760
so that's not that type of sprint. I actually have been to a lot of sprints, but I don't

28
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,960
actually understand why it's called a sprint. And what does it mean? So I, you know, I have

29
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,240
to give a talk, right? So I have to look it up. I have to find it on the internet. And

30
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,080
then, so in the internet actually says that in, you know, software development, sometimes,

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,760
you know, we have this development cycle and then you will have these kind of sprints.

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,480
That means that for a small team of member, they have to, you know, they may have a lot

33
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,320
of problem to solve or they have a lot of new features need to add. So they would, you

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:47,000
know, put that go into small task and then try to finish it within a set amount of time.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,600
So that's the sprint. It's software development. So basically just sit together and finish

36
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,360
some small tasks. That's basically what a sprint means in software development. But

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,040
when we go to a conference, we are not actually developing a software. Nobody pay, well, nobody

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,960
got to pay you, you know, give you money in the conference. So you, you know, you don't

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,720
go to the conference to work, well, except maybe me, but you don't, you don't, you know,

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,200
you don't go to a conference, you know, to expect to be developing some software and

41
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,160
get paid, right? So what does it mean about a sprint in a conference? So in the sprint

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
in the conference, so I think some of you already know, especially for those of you

43
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,360
who has been to a sprint, that basically it's just fixing some bugs and writing some, you

44
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,440
know, a test and then closing some issues. Isn't it? Like we just, you know, go to find

45
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:52,000
an open source project and then go to the GitHub and then do what, you know, you think

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,680
a contribution would be. And it's just to find issues and try to make a PR, you know,

47
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:07,080
make it do be accepted. And then everybody's happy. But I would like to say that a sprint

48
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,400
contribution is just, is not limited to just code contribution. A lot of time people mistaken

49
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,320
and thought that open source contribution need to be technical, need to be some code

50
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,800
or some tests. Some people may think, oh yeah, documentation. Yes. But that's, you know,

51
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,120
that's some people like, that's people with experience with things that documentation

52
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,760
is also important. Most people just think that I need to write some code to contribute

53
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,040
to a project, which I'm going to tell you today. That's not true. This is, I was just

54
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,040
inspired by the keynote just before because she was talking about the conversational AI

55
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,520
and things like that. I would like to introduce you to this. This is a Mozilla common voice

56
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:02,400
project. I have contributed to it before, but I didn't write any code. I just go and

57
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,520
speak my mother tongue because at that time I found this project by a tweet, someone saying

58
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,400
that, you know, oh, they need a Cantonese speaker to contribute to this database and

59
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,840
to, you know, also listen to verify whether some recordings are correct and things like

60
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:30,360
that. So, when I was at the keynote, I was, you know, trying to understand it, I think,

61
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,200
oh, yes, because in a lot of machine learning and things like that, it's written or the

62
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:44,040
database that they use would be in more popular language, English, or, you know, now they're,

63
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,400
like, I think that by the example that was shown in the keynote, the Spanish model was

64
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,200
quite good as well. But if you speak any other language or maybe, you know, you know, someone

65
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,320
who speak any other language that is less spoken, then that may be something you can

66
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:08,040
contribute to open source. It's not code. It's just what you can do to help the community.

67
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,560
This is again a picture that's missing. I forgot that the picture won't work if I use

68
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,240
another computer. But anyway, this picture, again, you can find it on Twitter. So this

69
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,080
is a picture that I was talking in PyCon Portugal, actually, sorry, it's JungleCon Europe in

70
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,000
Portugal last week. So this is at the end of the conference. I took a picture at the

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,760
auditorium where, during the closing, when there are lots of volunteers that come on

72
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,160
stage and then, you know, everybody claps because we thank them because they contribute

73
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,480
to the community. They didn't, like, well, maybe they also can, you know, they're also

74
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,680
technical, maybe they can code or maybe they work as a software developer, but they contribute

75
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,600
to the community by other things, by organizing things, by, you know, and organize the coffee

76
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,840
break, you know, code won't give you coffee break and the yummy pastry that you just had,

77
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,000
right? So someone needs to organize that. Someone needs to make that happen. And there's also

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,600
contribution to organize events to do stuff that's not code-based for the community. But

79
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,160
then go back to the sprints, like, why we do the sprints? Why we just, like, not, you

80
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:36,080
know, do what we want for the community? Well, because the sprint is actually something

81
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:43,920
that would really help you in your journey in the community, I would say, because there

82
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,120
are a few benefits that I can think of that I think that would really, you would really

83
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:57,520
enjoy and benefit from the sprint. For example, you can make new friends. Some example, including,

84
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,000
you know, if you go to a sprint at the conference, you will meet some project maintainers that

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,040
you may have used the package or the library for your work for a long time, but you have

86
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,520
never met the maintainers. In my example, when I was started working as a data scientist,

87
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:25,440
I used pandas a lot, right? So I hope all of you have heard about pandas, at least. So

88
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,560
it's a library for managing data, so it's very popular. And by going to a sprint, I

89
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,440
matched the maintainer of pandas for the first time, and they are really nice people. I

90
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,720
wasn't expecting that because at that time I was not that, you know, I was new to the

91
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,800
community. I don't understand too much how it works. I just think that all these people

92
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,000
must be genius that they create this stuff for us to use for free. But when I meet them,

93
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,160
they are actually real people. They are just like you and me, but they may have created

94
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,080
something or working on something that is very popular. I do have a lot of respect for

95
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,720
them, but they are also very nice. And just like they would talk to you, they would, you

96
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,520
know, so you thought they are, oh my God, like these people, maybe they are too good

97
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,480
for me to talk to. No, they would talk to you. It's very nice that you become their

98
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,720
friends. And then you can learn about a new package. There are things that you may have

99
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,960
not never heard of. You may, it's maybe something that is outside of your work domain that you

100
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,800
may never, ever know what it's going to do. If you go to a sprint, then usually at the

101
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,080
beginning of the sprint, people will come and explain what the project they are leading.

102
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,760
So some of the fun ones are like, for example, I learned about a library called Pi Game Zero

103
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,320
that actually is about making games or pipe them. Something that I would never think about

104
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,440
I would know and pipe and could do at that time. And so I would know about a new project

105
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,040
and then a new package that you have never heard of. And if it's not for the sprint,

106
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,880
I would never get a chance to know what it is and look at the code and try it out myself.

107
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,960
Also to get inspired, a lot of times, you know, you keep working for your work or something,

108
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,360
your code, you use the package that you use every day, you thought you know it inside

109
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,680
out, you thought you are a very advanced user. But at the sprint, when you actually look

110
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,800
at the source code of the project, then you would actually understand that there may be

111
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,320
another better way of doing it. That you have never thought of if you are just doing your

112
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:52,400
day-to-day work. So which is very good. And something that, you know, I think it's an

113
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,600
experience that you can't really get a lot when you are just working with the same group

114
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,440
of people in your company and things like that. The last thing is to collaborate. A

115
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:10,520
lot of times, I have, I see people that they are maybe working on similar libraries. They

116
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:17,080
would actually cross-check how do you do this? Or maybe there are some upstream dependencies

117
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:25,000
that, you know, for example, in Python US, we have sprints. And then I was working with

118
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,760
a maintainer of the hypothesis. So, you know, we were testing our things and then we found

119
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:40,160
out, oh, there is something that maybe the newer version of Python, C Python, that gives

120
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,960
us a strange error or something like that. So there is a chance because the C Python

121
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,600
developers are sitting in the next room, just next door. You can go there and hello, I have

122
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,840
this problem. And talk to them. So not just that, but other libraries like PyTest. We

123
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,560
also try to test a lot of things with PyTest. And sometimes if we have a question, we can

124
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,280
just ask the people working on PyTest. So it's very easy to collaborate. Instead of

125
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,080
you may have to open an issue, well, you can still open an issue during the sprints.

126
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,200
But on top of that, you know, there is something that you may be lost in the communication,

127
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,920
in the typing. You can just talk to the real person who may take care of that issue for

128
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,560
you. So that's really good. So this is, again, the picture of the ice cream because I want

129
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,880
to say that with the ice cream sprints, you can also make friends. Maybe exchange ideas,

130
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:43,360
but maybe not sit down and code. So that's the only difference. So you do learn a lot

131
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,720
in the sprint, which is something that I am advocating for, that for people, because

132
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,280
I've seen a lot of times during the conference. You know, some conference they will have sprint

133
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,840
date as their tradition. But I have met some participant that they would just disappear

134
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,520
during the sprint date. It's fine, but I would recommend if you have never tried, maybe think

135
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,840
about that. I will tell you my personal experience. Again, I was sprinting on hypothesis. So who

136
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,360
have used hypothesis before and know what it is? So one, two, a few. Okay, good. So hypothesis

137
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:28,200
is a testing library that is doing property-based testing. So I won't dive into too much detail,

138
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,680
but it's just a testing library. If you want to know more, you can watch my previous talks

139
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,960
in other conferences. So I was working on hypothesis. I have used hypothesis before,

140
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:46,560
a little bit. But then by going to the sprint, I learned something new, because who knows

141
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,960
that there is a ghost writer in hypothesis? None. Yeah, so I wasn't one of you. I didn't

142
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,240
heard about ghost writer before, but because I was at the sprints, I was contributing to

143
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,520
a hypothesis. And then I was tackling this issue with ghost writer. Then I was scratching

144
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,880
my head. Wait a second. What is a ghost writer? So I read the documentation of ghost writer.

145
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,360
I understand what it's trying to achieve. Look at the code base and try to solve the

146
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,560
problem that that issue was describing. So by going to the sprints, by contribution,

147
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,040
you learn something new that you may overlook, because you have never used it before and

148
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:36,840
never heard of it before. So that's the benefit of doing that. There's also other great ideas

149
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,040
can come from the sprints. A lot of times, you know, we have a lot of amazing projects

150
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:49,240
that people are doing during the sprint. So this is actually something that all of you

151
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,000
can contribute, because this is the project of translating the Python documentation into

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,360
Spanish. So I think the first time I heard about this effort was a few years ago, I think,

153
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,360
in maybe Euro Python. But I think it started in Python US years ago. So I think it's still

154
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,560
ongoing because you can see that it's now Python 3.10.7, but Python 3.11 is coming out

155
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,440
and there will be new features and new things that need to be translated. So next time,

156
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,720
you know, maybe consider, you know, maybe talk to someone who is more experienced in

157
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,320
this effort and then if you go to a sprints, you can maybe lead the effort to start translating

158
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:42,400
some new things about the C Python documentation. So by doing that, actually, you are contributing

159
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,320
also to C Python, going back to the point that not all contribution are code contribution.

160
00:16:49,320 --> 00:17:01,600
It's also a contribution, so highly recommend that. So to sum up, I think, is like everything

161
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,640
just go back to the community. So missing picture again. So this picture, actually, you

162
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,120
don't have to look at it online, you can just go downstairs, back to the main hall. Next

163
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,280
to the registration, there was a bot. So there was a bot yesterday, I took a picture yesterday,

164
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,800
so it asked what does Python mean to you? And people write stuff there, right? So I

165
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:32,440
try to understand what people are written down. So I saw one person with the green pen

166
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:41,160
written down community. Which is community. So what Python means to you is the community.

167
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:49,480
And I totally agree on that. Because for me, a lot of people ask me, why do you prefer

168
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,840
Python? It's a very good programming language. I would answer that. I am not technical enough

169
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,320
to judge different languages because I can write Python, I learn a little bit of maybe

170
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,720
JavaScript and things, but I don't know enough to judge what programming language is better

171
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,240
than the other. Or maybe there's no good answer to that because they may be for different

172
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,360
tasks. But I can proudly tell people that the Python community could probably be the

173
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:25,160
best. That's why I am in this zone. I am in the Python community. So community is a very

174
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:34,480
important part of Python, I would say. So without the community, there will be no sprints.

175
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,080
Just like I said before, things doesn't just happen. Just like the coffee break, just like

176
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,840
the keynote, just like anything, the room that you are sitting in right now. Without the

177
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,120
community, without people organizing it, there will be no sprints. Nothing will happen. There

178
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,120
will be no conference and no sprints. But without the sprints, there will be less contributions.

179
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,080
People are less aware that they can actually do something for the community. They can translate

180
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,160
the documentation, they can, you know, if you can, you can also work on a code if you

181
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,480
want to. Or you can, you know, try some new libraries and find out some issues and report

182
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,880
it back. Without the sprints, there may still be contributions, but there will be much less.

183
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,080
Because you are refined in your zone of your work. Maybe a few, you know, pet projects

184
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,080
and hobby projects, but it's quite limited. And then without the contributions, there's

185
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,880
no community. Because, again, you know, without the contribution, without people putting effort

186
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,280
in, we won't be gathering here. The Python community won't be the same. So this is the

187
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,880
picture. Again, look up on my Twitter. Actually, don't look it up on my Twitter. Look it up

188
00:19:51,880 --> 00:20:00,920
on the EuroSciPy Twitter. This is probably the top tweet from EuroSciPy. So EuroSciPy

189
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:10,720
happened at the end of August. So just two months ago now. Or actually, like last, yeah,

190
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:19,120
it's like end of August. So it was EuroSciPy. And then it's a five-day conference, right?

191
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,280
Very intense, you know. If you have been to a conference, you know, conference is, you

192
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,560
know, you socialize with people when you work, you know, have to use your brain because you

193
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:34,720
go to workshops and talks and then you socialize again at the end and then maybe go out late.

194
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,000
But at the end of EuroSciPy, there's a day of sprint. And this is the, supposedly, like

195
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,280
if it doesn't mess up, the picture was taken during the sprint. And it was a room full

196
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,000
of people. I was very impressed because I told you, I've met people that sometimes

197
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,360
they left after the conference. They may be too tired or they have other things at home

198
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,640
they have to take care of, they have to go back early or they would rather check out the

199
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:12,200
city. But at EuroSciPy, it was the first, actually, it was the first time they organized

200
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:19,600
in Basel. So it's a new city for a lot of people. People decided to not go around but

201
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,760
stay in the room, actually two rooms but they are both full, around 70 people. Compared

202
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,080
to a conference, there's around 200 people that stay in the room to contribute to the

203
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,640
open source project. I was very impressed and I hope that may be the case for a lot of different

204
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:46,520
conferences as well. So I've told you a lot about why sprint is good, why contributing

205
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:55,240
is good. But sometimes we have challenges. So who know about HectorvaFest, which is happening

206
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:05,040
now? Yes, some of you. So every year there's this event called HectorvaFest. The idea is

207
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,200
to encourage people to contribute to open source project. I haven't been actively participated

208
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,160
for a few years but in the past when I was actively participating, they would give free

209
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,360
t-shirts for people who signed up and contribute to free pool requests, to free contribution,

210
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:32,440
you have a free t-shirt. The idea is really good but technically it created some problem

211
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,880
because they create a lot of noise, a lot of people. I can't tell you what their intention

212
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,880
is but I have been told by some maintainers that there are some pool requests that are

213
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:58,880
not a very effective pool request because they may fix some minor typos or just some

214
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,000
even, for example today I saw a tweet, one maintainer was saying someone just go to the

215
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,200
Q&A page and add question and answer in front of the question and answers, which is not

216
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,760
necessary but people do make that kind of pool request, try to finish the quest to get

217
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:29,280
the free t-shirt. So it's a lot of maintainers nowadays, they doubt about this effort, they

218
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:37,200
doubt about whether this is a healthy thing to encourage people to contribute like that.

219
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:47,120
I would say that yes, Hector Buffett's do have a fault, some people may not truly understand

220
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:55,240
the idea of contributing and they just want to get the t-shirt but I think by organizing

221
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:03,040
a sprinch those things can be minimized because in a sprinch people sit together in the room,

222
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,960
you can have an introductory talk or something to explain to people what's the idea of a

223
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:16,000
contribution and how they can contribute and also there will be better guidance because

224
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,160
the maintainer will be there sitting with them and guide them through some pool requests

225
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,320
or issues that is suited for their ability so they don't have to be struggling in finding

226
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,080
something that they can do so they end up doing something that is not very helpful for

227
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:41,760
the project. So that's why I think that if you ask me how to improve Hector Buffett's,

228
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:49,880
I would say we can't just run Hector Buffett's without the support with the sprints that

229
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:58,200
we actually put an effort to guide people to contribute and also some maintainer may

230
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,280
say that running a sprinch, guiding people to solve the problem is more difficult than

231
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:10,400
solving the problem themselves but why do they do that? Same question may happen in your

232
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,120
company that why do you teach your junior developers or interns to do stuff? It's faster

233
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,480
to do it yourself. If you stay up, maybe stay later at work one day you can finish all of

234
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:31,880
them. Why spend another extra day or two to teach them, to guide them, to make them grow?

235
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,720
The problem is we need to make them grow. We need to have people. One day we would all

236
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,440
want to be retired and if young people or new people doesn't come in and get the help

237
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:51,040
that they need, then we may not have good developers or it will only be the developers

238
00:25:51,040 --> 00:26:01,520
who are just like in the environment that they have advantage of. That's why if we want

239
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:09,160
a community with more diversity and inclusion, we should also put in more efforts to support

240
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,520
people who are maybe less confident because they see themselves as minority and you need

241
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:21,080
to give them more encouragement and more support. That's why if you are a maintainer or if

242
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,280
you are a more senior developer, try to help others, try to be kind and help younger or

243
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:37,080
maybe newer people in the community to grow, to learn. I think that's a D.N. of my talk.

244
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:47,720
I would like to ask this question and leave this to you. Do we want the spring at PyCon

245
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:55,960
Spain next year? If your answer is yes, I would love to see that. Talk to the organizers

246
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,840
and tell them that you would love to join us. You would love to be sitting with amazing

247
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,840
people next year and maybe it will happen. That's it for me. Thank you.
