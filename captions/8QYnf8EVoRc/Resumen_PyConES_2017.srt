1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,280
thisyo

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,280
The PICON are conferences around the PyZone programming language

4
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,280
and the PICON is in particular that national level conference

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,280
that takes place in Spain every year, being this the fifth edition we make.

6
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Every year we try to take the PICON to some different cities in Spain.

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
We start in Madrid, Zaragoza, Valencia, Almería and this year Cáceres.

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,280
We go all over Spain, the idea is to get to the best people

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,280
and it is organized both by the Association of PICON in Spain and by a local group.

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
The idea is that we all get together and talk about the PICON.

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,280
We all come to share our experience, our knowledge

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,280
and we will spend a while and get to know each other.

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,280
It is like Christmas, but for computer scientists.

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Hello, we are OpenSystems, a Spanish company

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,280
specialized in open source technology and very focused on big data,

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
machine learning, data analysis.

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,280
We are in PyCon because we love to contribute with open source communities,

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,280
mainly with Python, which is one of the technologies we use the most.

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,280
We have contact with the developers and users of this technology.

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,280
It is the third year that we contribute as sponsors

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,280
and we will continue to do so in the future.

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
Python is a programming language.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Normally, Python scientists say that it comes with the batteries

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
because it is used for a lot of things.

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,280
It is very easy to use, the barrier to entry is very small,

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,280
so you can find it in a lot of places.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
It is used to learn, it is used in many companies,

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
it is my company that we use.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
It is very easy to start programming in Python

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
and there are many tools already developed.

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,280
For me, the great thing about Python is the community.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
We are celebrating here.

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,280
If you have a problem, I am sure there is someone who will call you

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
and say, I want to program this, I will help you and I will teach you.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,280
I came to this event because I am very interested in the Python community

36
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,280
and everything that is being done here.

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,280
I have come here because it is an annual meeting that we have.

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,280
I have already given a workshop yesterday of TensorFlow

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,280
with how to predict death in the game of thrones

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:45,280
and this afternoon I will talk about how to make command lines with click.

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,280
For us as Ticotea, this event is our home.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,280
We have been participating in the last years and not only coming here

43
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,280
to meet engineers like those we have within the company

44
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,280
but also to share what we do, our projects, our ambition,

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,280
our ideas, the new developments that we are thinking

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:18,280
and have the feeling of community and being able to share with everyone.

47
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Why Gacere?

48
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Why Gacere? It is a good question.

49
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,280
The truth is that it is something curious because all the previous organizations

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,280
have been a local team that was what is a site in the site.

51
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Here the truth is that we were all out and that has made it a little more difficult

52
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
but we were counting on the help of the university

53
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,280
and that has made us all this easier.

54
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,280
The local team of Gacere was tied to the head and said

55
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,280
well, in Gacere and they encouraged, they set up a spectacular proposal,

56
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
the site is spectacular, so nothing,

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:05:02,280
here we are to meet Gacere and have fun at the weekend.

58
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,280
I liked the event because we do a lot of networking,

59
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
you know other companies that do other projects,

60
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,280
you find out about things that exist, new developments

61
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,280
and the truth is that we consider it as an important event

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,280
within the year, within the company of the two brands

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,280
and we try to collaborate as sponsors every year.

64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,280
We are André Ebruy, we are a team of English with a Malaga headquarters,

65
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
we are already on the team of the Malaga team,

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,280
we are in charge of doing the transition from Divisa to the 3D Final.

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Last year we started sponsoring the Pycones in Almería,

68
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,280
this year we have repeated and we try to repeat later too.

69
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,280
We also sponsor the group Malaga Paizcon,

70
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
since a couple of years ago.

71
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,280
What we are currently looking for are profiles,

72
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Paizcon and DevOps,

73
00:05:48,280 --> 00:06:14,280
if you are interested, you can come with us.
