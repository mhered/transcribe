1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Good morning. Thank you for coming to this room.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The first chat we will have is from Alejandro Cortez.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You will present yourself in a machine.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's give him a big applause.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The question is at the end of the session.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good morning. Do you hear me well?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will do it without a microphone because I think I can.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am Alejandro Cortez, a humble teacher.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I have been involved in many things.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I have been involved in engineering, industrial, it is strange.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
My fundamental specialty is that I am a forensic and judicial informatic peritoneum.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I have been a lawyer since 1986.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I am a lawyer since 1986.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I was probably not born when I was already in contact with the Bites.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I am an expert in cybersecurity.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I try to make students know something.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I can't do it, but we will continue.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I am a professor of FPL at the School of Engineering and Engineering.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I try to convey everything as possible.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I am a master of international cybersecurity in Ecuador and here in Spain.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I am very passionate about this.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am a security engineer and an analysis of forensics.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If I am defined, these are the three specialties.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I mix them all.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I am a forensic informatic, a protection of cybercrime,

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
any fraud or any fraud, I get involved.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It is a problem I have.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am also a multimedia engineer at ESIC

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and I teach at the International School of Pogrado

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
about the dark web that I use with Python.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I love to use things.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You will see the reason for this chat now.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Public articles, conferences, investigations,

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
what happens to me in my head,

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
if I sleep more than six hours, I start to go around and around,

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I create an article, a video, or whatever.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My social media channels are on Twitter and Telegram,

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and my email is at cortearrobaexerencia.com

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
in case it is longer than a tweet.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have open messages,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
so you can always write to me and I will see it.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That is something I usually don't see.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I recently discovered that I speak Chinese.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I think I am not going to speak Chinese here,

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but a master told me, they speak Chinese.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That destroyed me.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I said, please, send me the WhatsApp,

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
because I have to say this.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If I speak Chinese, you ask me, what is this?

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's go to the mess, to the jail or father.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
As a forensic engineer,

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
because if you combine my experience,

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
the subject of the computer field,

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and the engineering, there you have it.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When we do a forensic experience,

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
we always have to geolocate

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
how we do the station and where we do it.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We have a protocol for that.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When I go to a station, in a notary,

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I say, I go to this place,

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but sometimes they call me and tell me,

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
no, you don't have to go to the site.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why? Because the tests are there,

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I have to get evidence from the place.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you have to go, you will be charged equally.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's what this talk gives.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I haven't been to Isla Pérez-Hil,

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but I usually go to the local,

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
with their GPS coordinates,

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and it's phenomenal.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The problem is that I have to go to the notary,

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
or the public notary, depending on who calls me,

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
if it's the judge,

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
or the client,

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and I have to take him there.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The notary doesn't want to move,

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
but if he wants to move, I have to take him there.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I had to cut it off a bit,

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
because from what we were going to talk about,

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
there are things I had to camouflage,

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
because it has a certain confidentiality,

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but it is almost 95% true.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, they asked me to do a police station,

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
a police station in my hometown,

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm from Málaga,

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and the plan is that I go from Málaga,

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I have continued to keep it,

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and I have been allying with the poor people,

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
they have given me nothing,

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and I have come here to ally with them.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, I have accepted the budget,

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and the fund provision,

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and I have to accept it,

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have to do it,

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I have to get the digital evidence,

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
in the site, I say,

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
well, I have to go, I'm getting lazy,

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
since the pandemic, I'm getting lazy to move,

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
but well, I'm going.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So I'm going with the client,

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going with the notary,

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to do the extraction.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I like to prepare the things before time,

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not going to see what I find.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I like it.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm going to a site,

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
we'll see where it is,

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm going to check it,

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll see what I find in the car,

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
because the same is true,

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
if the evidence is entered in a armored suit,

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and I have to break it,

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have to break it,

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have to carry the biggest one,

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
well, I'll look where I was at the place,

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
The GPS says, well, more or less, phenomenal.

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,920
The location is fictitious, because I already tell you that I had to change it.

118
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,800
This is a place that I had an office in Malga, more or less, to make the idea.

119
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,040
And now it turns out that I arrive at day D, hour H, notary, present, client, present,

120
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,440
location, fictitious, this coordinate, and the location changes the coordinate.

121
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,960
When I go, the GPS that I carried was not the coordinates that I had located.

122
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,200
I bought it once, twice, changed from GPS, took another, and they are not the coordinates.

123
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,400
The notary, who knows me, already looks at me, he says, oops, something happens to him,

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,080
because it is normal, things do not match.

125
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,200
I say, well, where am I?

126
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,640
Actually, they do not match, and, let's see, I like to carry things in the middle.

127
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,920
Well, man, you have many times to improvise, but here, in front of the notary, you cannot improvise.

128
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,680
You have to give security, because if not, the uncle asks you in any story,

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,640
he asks you your age and you make mistakes.

130
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:13,320
In total, my face, worried, no.

131
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,360
The following, as I think I was more worried than when my children were born.

132
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,760
I said, what's going to happen? Well, cancel it.

133
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,280
The notary charges for displacement, charges for everything, and pays for the client,

134
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,960
but in this case, when I cancel it, I say, I have to pay the notary another day.

135
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,840
What's wrong here?

136
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,160
Well, this is little for what I started thinking about.

137
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,880
I do not know, this has never happened to me.

138
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,400
I talk to my fellow experts, I talk to everyone and nobody tells me anything.

139
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,520
This, something strange happens here. I investigate and say, let's see, I'm going to start looking at GPS,

140
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,400
let's see what happens and I find GPS inhibitors.

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,800
We have mobile inhibitors when we are near a police station, it is normal,

142
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,720
you are talking on the phone and you hang up.

143
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,240
My mother knows all the nights that I go through the National Police of my neighborhood and they cut me.

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,880
But hey, but GPS is more strange, no?

145
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,640
There are GPS inhibitors and they are bought for 4 euros, but this is not a blocker.

146
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,760
The GPS has changed me.

147
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,560
And it scares you, no?

148
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,600
So, look, this is Aliexpress, I have picked it up from there,

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,080
you can even connect it directly to the center of the car and say, but no, I don't want to block this.

150
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,840
Something else happens here, no?

151
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,160
They have displaced the signal.

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:41,720
And this, how? This is the place that the GPS sends me and this is the place where I am,

153
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,800
I have to do the peri-sial.

154
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,440
There is a distance of 12 kilometers.

155
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,000
For me it is a 12-kilometer distance, it is a barbarity.

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,320
And I say, what's going on?

157
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,200
I investigate, I see the issue of wall-driven,

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,480
what happens is that there is a possibility of deceiving the signal of the optometres,

159
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,120
especially in the United States.

160
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,880
You know that truck drivers should not drive for more than two hours,

161
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,280
immediately, three hours, and that goes all in a machine and others,

162
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,400
because they deceive them.

163
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,800
Here not so much, but they deceive them here, they don't care, but in the United States they do.

164
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,160
And it says that the GPS is vulnerable to this issue, no?

165
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,200
And I say, well, but that's the United States, this is bad, no?

166
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,360
I don't know, it's true that Google has already arrived, but when I said this,

167
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
Google was not there, no?

168
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,000
I say, well, nothing, let's see.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,560
I keep looking and I find that it can be done a supply of GPS.

170
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,160
And this article, look, it was achieved a kilometer and a half ago in 2008,

171
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,560
more than five years had passed, that is, someone has the technology to move,

172
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,240
that is very dangerous and above all, it can be a risk of security of all levels,

173
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,480
especially if you have a airport nearby or anything nearby,

174
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,360
because imagine a person who is driving a plane and says,

175
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,000
oh, what is not here, although you see the runway, I see the runway,

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,480
but it is not 12 kilometers further and instead of landing on the airport,

177
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,360
you get into a polygon.

178
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,280
That is national security is quite important and quite.

179
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,680
And it touches me and I say, go for it, I've already touched the rare case,

180
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,840
it is that someone has to make the easy cases, because I don't get it.

181
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,320
Well, I'll tell you a little bit, in case you don't know how GPS is,

182
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,000
a system that everyone calls it in a way, they invented it in the United States,

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,120
there is 31 operating satellites there and the Soviet Union has its system,

184
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,760
in Europe we have ours, in China they have theirs,

185
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,840
and well, there is a great technology behind it,

186
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,880
so that the location is the most precise.

187
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,720
Look, now I will show you the GPS that I have used,

188
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,440
it returns me to the series port, because everything in plane text mode,

189
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,480
and you can always, the most important thing about what returns you is the time,

190
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,480
the GPS coordinates, this is my home from here in Granada,

191
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,560
you don't record it much, because if not, the altitude,

192
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,520
and you say more or less yes, the altitude, and the time, sorry, and the day,

193
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,200
that is the most important thing, the UTC time coordinates GPS,

194
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,840
the altitude at sea level and the date of the satellite.

195
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,160
Well, okay, but it is a georegulation without G,

196
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
it is clear, without GPS, right?

197
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,480
So, well, what other ways do we have to locate ourselves?

198
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,760
Well, we can call Legolas, who is a machine and he knows where the sun is,

199
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,360
he knows where it is, okay?

200
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,600
Tranco, also, Tranco, this, how was it, Aragorn,

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,640
I call him Tranco, okay?

202
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,280
This man also knows where he is, but I don't have him,

203
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,240
so the people's pastor called him and he knows when the sun comes out,

204
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
what time it is, he knows perfectly where it is,

205
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,600
but I don't have anyone close here either, right?

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,680
So the object of this conference is, well, working on technology,

207
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,520
how not?

208
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Because we have the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi, well, this is such a step,

209
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,680
because this is not important, the important thing is what we are here, right?

210
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,120
We have the 2.4 GHz, which is the most extended, and we have the 5 GHz, right?

211
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,480
Normally, a router is needed and the most important thing about routers

212
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,600
is that, apart from giving access to the internet and others,

213
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,320
well, I love using IP Info.io to locate IP addresses,

214
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,000
and the other things are the derivatives that each one uses, right?

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,120
So the most important thing about routers is that most routers

216
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,160
have the BSSID, which is the Chromebook of BASY SERVICE SET INDIVIDEFILE,

217
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,440
it looks like a Mac address, but it's not, it's not,

218
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,200
there are people who mention it, but it's not a Mac, that's precisely, right?

219
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,800
So you can't easily change it because it comes in the ROM of routers,

220
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,440
in the ROM of routers and in the ROM of the Alambri accession points,

221
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,440
that is, if you want to change the direction of the BSSID of a device,

222
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,120
well, nothing, you have to change the ROM, or hack the ROM,

223
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,120
to see who has the technology to take the ROM and reflect it, I don't.

224
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,120
There are people who will be able to, but well, we are already talking about bigger words,

225
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,120
and then solve it again and it works.

226
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Well, with two cables, maybe three, but to reflect a ROM?

227
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,120
No. Well, it is confused with the SSID, which is the name of the Wi-Fi,

228
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
but the name of the Wi-Fi you change it with the nose,

229
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,120
just as your router or not, you put it in and you change it, right?

230
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Well, and all this for what?

231
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Look, in 2010 I found the article in which Google went through all,

232
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
through all of Spain and all over the world,

233
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,120
precisely by armacenando this value, right?

234
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,120
The BSSID, he knows that sound changes, then, of course,

235
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
they put a mult because of private traffic,

236
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,120
but it was not because of taking the BSSID, but it was because of traffic,

237
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
but it doesn't matter, right?

238
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,120
He says that if we put Nomapp in our SSID, he does not armacen it.

239
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
I did not put it, what armacen?

240
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
It doesn't matter.

241
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,120
He will take me on the other hand.

242
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Well, then, can you geolocate by Wi-Fi?

243
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Okay, but in bad hands we can make a man in the middle

244
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,120
and well, and here we don't end today, right?

245
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
So what did I do?

246
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
Well, look, that was in a polygon.

247
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,120
I scanned all the BSSIDs of the polygon

248
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
before it came to the notary, I realized, I said,

249
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
let's see, it's true, now I tell you, it's true that there are today

250
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,120
systems that already do it alone, but when I did this, I didn't know it, okay?

251
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,120
That's why I did this jaleo.

252
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,120
We arrived at one of the Malga University, which I used as a reference,

253
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,120
the Malga University was, or was, sorry, it is in a very, very specific place in Malga,

254
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
I used it as a reference and everything else,

255
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,120
well, I took the distance and I came up with, well, the formula of distance

256
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,120
existed there, the programs, and you are able to, now I tell you exactly,

257
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,120
what two values ​​you give a very approximate distance, right?

258
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:25,080
The public

259
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,120
fairytale, what I asked for, sorry, was to check and there was faith in the

260
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,120
provincial that this was a certain distance, it will not be in the GPS,

261
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,120
because if I go to the GPS and there is someone who is dissing me,

262
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,120
it does not serve my provincial, just as something that is as evident as the GPS,

263
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:05,120
which seems, okay, thank you, which seems that without a movable and movable,

264
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,120
well, I could not base it there, right? Well, the federal, I told him,

265
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
look, you have to give faith that on a screen this distance comes out,

266
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
with that I conform, it will be my provincial in that distance,

267
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,120
not in the GPS, I did not mention anything, look, this is a 3B Raspberry Pi,

268
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:31,120
put inside a touch screen, to which I put a GPS, that costs 15 euros or 20 euros,

269
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
not more, by the USB port, it recognizes it from the remote control,

270
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
what?

271
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,120
No, no, no, but hey, I have that issue of talking about it, right?

272
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Well, anyway, what did I do with Python? How not to use C?

273
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I go crazy and with the notary there, not looking, but he says,

274
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
when are we going to be back? I can not tell you within four months,

275
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,120
I have to do something quick, how do I do it quick? I do not know if you can see it,

276
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,120
well, I import what I am going to use, I create a few functions,

277
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,120
this is the function of the Panacea, that is, I found the function,

278
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,120
the function that works, it is true that there is an equation of Maxwell that gives it to you,

279
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,120
I do not know, well, there I will go for two weeks and there I did not find it,

280
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,120
well, in the end, Derek Wartner has his jihava and you have it,

281
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,120
I recognize that it occurred to him, because it worked for me,

282
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,120
there were 50 more if none worked, I mean, but if I have the route at 5 meters,

283
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,120
how is it? Well, that works, you say how many additional functions

284
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,120
that I returned to the frequency of the quality that only the parameters that I needed

285
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:53,120
obtained the SSID because I had a reference of it, especially when it has a list of a lot of WIFIs,

286
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,120
and what happened? Look, this is another way of doing it,

287
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,120
but I say, for the urgency of doing it, I said, what do I do?

288
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Well, I run a operating system command that puts it in a file and then I read the file,

289
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,120
possibly there are a thousand ways to do this better, much more professional,

290
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,120
but normally in an operating system it is that it does not give you time and you have to go,

291
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,120
it is true that you have a second veil off your pocket, but I say, come on, what works,

292
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,120
let's see what works, when I get jubile I improve it,

293
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
I think that will never happen because I always said, when you are a teacher, I improve it,

294
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,120
I improve it, I lie, neither. Well, I already say this, it is the only so strange thing I did,

295
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:46,120
I emulated the operating system, and well, I simply put it in a, I don't know if it comes from before,

296
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,120
I think I ate it, I have a Whale True, people tell me what a Whale True does,

297
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:57,120
because it is not an infinite loop, I want it to be showing and mom is recording it,

298
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,120
I say, well, nothing happens, of course it can be in a database, it can do it millions of ways,

299
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:09,120
yes, yes, it can be improved, but it is that, no, I'm sorry, no.

300
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,120
So, well, look, it is very simple, the truth is that these are my students have already learned

301
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,120
and are saying, when are you going to teach it? I say, come to the PaiKong.

302
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Well, and what I do is call and that I get out of the screen the frequency, the distance

303
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,120
is approximate, I said, look, it is approximate, but well, when you have a lot of approximate distance,

304
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,120
in the end you have a more or less specific location in the circle where all confluents, there.

305
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:43,120
The notary understood me, look, the notaries today every time more know more about our own,

306
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:51,120
and he understood me and gave me faith, I paid him, fantastic, because he has ever told me,

307
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,120
I mean, hey, I don't understand this here well and I'm saying, well, I'm going to explain it to you,

308
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm going to explain it to you as if it were a judge who is like a three-year-old child and finds out,

309
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:10,120
I say, fantastic, come on, well, I get a similar result, like this, with the SSID,

310
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:20,120
I say, similar, I have to tune it, and with the frequency of the signal and with the level of the signal

311
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,120
you can calculate the distance, it is approximate, it is true, it is approximate, but well, I tell you,

312
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,120
if you don't have GPS, if you can't use it, well, even if it is a potato, not a cable connected to the potato

313
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,120
that I give you a signal, right, because the same, well, I have to do this all morning, okay,

314
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,120
I find out that there are services that do more or less the same, but they are not fun,

315
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,120
those who know me from here know that I am like a goat, and they tell me, many times they tell me,

316
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,120
you're going to put the goat, well, I put it, I'm like a goat.

317
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,120
The services, well, Alexander Milynikov has a service, but it doesn't work for me,

318
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,120
it doesn't exist for me, Stars Cop is a Russian web that has us all monitored, be careful,

319
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,120
the same doesn't annex to Russia now, GeoWifi, well, if I go back to the HDMI, okay,

320
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,120
GeoWifi also does it, it is in Python that allows you to obtain it, but I, it is preferable to do it,

321
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,120
I, on my own, and wiggel.net has a fantastic service, I can finish it first,

322
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,120
it has a fantastic service that, to be honest, you can take it on your mobile,

323
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,120
they give you points for being the most wifi-mete, well, I can go back every day,

324
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,120
when I go in the car, I am showing you everything I get, I say,

325
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,120
let's see if I get up from 10,000, because I don't get up, right, there has to be someone who is

326
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,120
traveling every day, but hey, the site is cool, right, let's see, this is hot, it seems that,

327
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:47,120
well, you look for anything, for a GPS, for a BSSID, whatever you want, there it is,

328
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,120
but I didn't know that, in the press, look, the civil war knows that, well,

329
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:01,120
I think this man who killed a girl, well, the journalist has no idea,

330
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,120
he talks about three different routes and a Mac address, it's not the Mac address,

331
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,120
it's the BSSID, but the journalists don't know about technology, right, well,

332
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:16,120
I found it and said, look, the Mac address, well, it's the BSSID,

333
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,120
you have to convey the concept well, you have no idea, well, it seems, remember,

334
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,120
look, when, as a reference, with a celebrity who has used a device,

335
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,120
a mobile, he takes me out 60,000 pages of everything he has done on the mobile,

336
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,120
and what happens, well, it includes the BSSID to which he has tried to connect,

337
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,120
it is fundamental to know that parameter, and people don't know it,

338
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,120
they think it's the name of the Wi-Fi, which is not, no, BSSID,

339
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,120
it's good to always have a GPS in your hand, because if we go less or less

340
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
knowing what the coordinates of your site are, and they change it,

341
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,120
then it's that there is some funny thing there, that funny thing can be as,

342
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,120
as I say, as denounceable as the one that, well, because it avoids the radar signal,

343
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
I have already told you about it, I don't know if you will take measures or not,

344
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,120
but I tell you, if you go back to the GPS, there is some funny thing that is moving the signal, right?

345
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Then I could say that it is called localization, this talk could be,

346
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,120
as a curiosity, well, we won the trial, the opposite part,

347
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,120
I wanted to attack by the GPS, but there was no GPS,

348
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,120
in front of the judge, they asked me, but why haven't you used the GPS?

349
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,120
I say, because the GPS is there, it's not the case, and in fact, we knew that there is,

350
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,120
in fact, in Malga, it has happened again, yesterday I myself,

351
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,120
a colleague asked me, who also dedicates himself to these foreign halos,

352
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,120
that they have a similar case, and that there is a person in jail because of this,

353
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,120
that is, there is some funny thing in Malga that is capable of changing the location of GPS.

354
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Well, anyway, we won.

355
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,120
My days I do it here, I am in the School of International Management,

356
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,120
trying to transmit all this knowledge that, for a lot of years, I accumulated,

357
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,120
and every day I have more things to tell, right?

358
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,120
And well, thank you very much, and I am at your disposal, you know, my networks,

359
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,120
my LinkedIn, in case there are, I burn, there are many people who know me,

360
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
because I burn the networks, I don't know, what I do is transmit,

361
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,120
that knowledge is not left.

362
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,120
And now your turn, one question, I think I'm in time, right?

363
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Thank you very much.

364
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I have a question.

365
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,120
I have a microphone.

366
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,120
This is not a big problem.

367
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Very good.

368
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Can you tell me something about the CSIV casting for you to decide?

369
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,120
Although you use it, someone who goes to the channel can't go to the same place.

370
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Well, I have a lot of networks that don't have a name, or they are just like 0x, 0x, 0x, 0x,

371
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,120
they don't have the same, but the CSIV of the SAC.

372
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,120
Ah, okay, because you can hide it, that yes, you don't have to do it.

373
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,120
And then you have to do it, and then you have to do it.

374
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,120
I had an opportunity, I would go to 80 wifi, I mean, you can be in the middle of the field,

375
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
like there are 80.

376
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:49,120
I take everything I ask, obviously, the more frequent I have, the further I go.

377
00:25:49,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Hello, good morning. Very interesting, I would like to ask, because we pay attention to this,

378
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:14,120
especially for a personal matter, because wifi is a very sensitive signal to the signal,

379
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:21,120
and maybe the distance is not according to the potential of the network,

380
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,120
and that can happen to someone who puts a switch on, or just a switch.

381
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Is that the problem you would like to put?

382
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:40,120
I would like to talk about everything, but not just a wifi, I put myself in a polygon and look at them all,

383
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:47,120
and I would come all night and all in the morning, because with one night you can't trust,

384
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:55,120
one day they are putting the window open, because you know that the glass is above the wifi.

385
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,120
So if you are above the office, you have the door open, as it was just in the plan,

386
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,120
well, a lot of wifi comes out, but you have the door and it comes out.

387
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,120
You scan everything, you have to do everything, you have to do everything.

388
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,120
With everything you have a place to control everything, but with one you can't trust,

389
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,120
as it is called, a sample is not reliable, 300, yes.

390
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Any other questions?

391
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:46,120
I have a question, I know that you know, but I have a question, how do you know if it is a program or how do you do it?

392
00:27:46,120 --> 00:28:01,120
What I do is ask them, I see it works, I see it works to learn something,

393
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,120
but if you want to get a cube, you have to ask me, I see it works.

394
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:17,120
The cube will arrive quickly and it is a system command.

395
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,120
In this case, you can use the wwlancer, what you see is the device, the Raspberry,

396
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,120
or whatever you want, I have a device, I will try again,

397
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I will say that this is my laptop and whatever, and I just want you to take the four words that I would like,

398
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,120
the SSID, the channel and the reality, simply so that I have it organized.

399
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:49,120
And I want it to come out in a little thing, here, it comes out.

400
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Then you take the two, there are a thousand ways to do it, you have to know with the hands,

401
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,120
I have done it wrong, you put it in a database, you have it there and you do it in the same way,

402
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:12,120
you see what you want, there are programs that you do, but I love putting my hand on the computer,

403
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:20,120
I do not know how to do it, but I do not know how to do it.

404
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:31,120
In relation to that screen, what is the quality of the data, of the representation

405
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,120
of the frequency and the reaction of the signal, I mean,

406
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:43,120
because it seems that a person who is a participant does that, the signal, the signal quality is low,

407
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,120
so it is quite simple, for example, a cloudy day, a cloudy day, the signal is also changing,

408
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
so it is something that is not ideal.

409
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Of course, but when you go to take samples, you do not take more, as I said,

410
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,120
you do not take more, I go back in the morning, at night, I take several samples,

411
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:06,120
which in conjunction, as you know, the VSSID does not change, you put it in a database

412
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,120
and then I do a study of that VSSID with all the readings that you have done

413
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,120
and with all the readings, you see how different colors change in the day.

414
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:14,620
If you take that, you can do your own

415
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:30,120
to have a close proximity with that and then with the 300 additional readings that you had.

416
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,620
So, with all together, approximately, you had the distance compared to the VSSID

417
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,120
of the base, which is what it is called.

418
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,120
And how reliable is it? I understand that you have been playing for a while,

419
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,620
but really...

420
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,120
How reliable? To me, the VSSID is reliable, but if I do not give it to me...

421
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,120
I understand, but from the point of view of the VSSID, I am not wrong,

422
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,620
so generating networks, of dynamic format, with the same numbers,

423
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,120
that in this area, if you want to do something different,

424
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
the VSSID is not something that is impossible.

425
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,620
No, no, of course, it is reliable.

426
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,620
We always use it as a whole.

427
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,120
But I also suppose, on the contrary, that it cannot be done.

428
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,120
There are many ways to get the VSSID, but on the other hand,

429
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,120
they wanted to defend the GPS, and as the GPS could not be used,

430
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
I used this.

431
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
It could have been thrown away, of course, it could have been thrown away,

432
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
but they did not fall into the system.

433
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I went with what I had.

434
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
How reliable?

435
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:38,120
In a judicial system, where the judge has the doubt, he leaves you free.

436
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,120
If you put the judge in his head, he leaves you free.

437
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,120
I used all my means, and he is free.

438
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
When he leaves, he falls.

439
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,120
He gave me the mouse and the other mouse.

440
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,120
But if you put it seriously, the other part is not him.

441
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Last question.

442
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,120
Hello, thank you for the presentation.

443
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,120
If you have any questions, if you have any questions,

444
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,120
please send them to the router, that is the ID, the police station.

445
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Because I know that mobile phones, if you have any questions,

446
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,120
the latest generation phones have been used for a whole month.

447
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Change that, that's good.

448
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,120
For us, the use of the user is dangerous,

449
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,120
because you cannot use it for this reason.

450
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,120
If you have a mobile phone, the generation is changing its generation.

451
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Do you have a router that you have used to launch?

452
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,120
I have not yet, but it is also true that a mobile phone that costs a lot.

453
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,120
A router that costs a lot of money, you will not buy it.

454
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,120
It is possible that there are certain

455
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,120
smart phones that are capable of changing that.

456
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,120
It is possible, mobile phones are also going to change that.

457
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
I have not found it, but it is possible that within

458
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,120
three or four years this will not be so reliable.

459
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,120
But now we must pass on to who will change their generation.

460
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Someone who has something to hide. The rest of the companies,

461
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,120
which is something that I want to say, but, because they are still having

462
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,120
cyber attacks every day.

463
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,120
As the rest of the companies do nothing, they put on the router

464
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,120
and they put it on, they are the same, because possibly

465
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,120
there is always a path of hope to make them at least know how to do it.

466
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Thank you.

467
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Applause.

468
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Music.
