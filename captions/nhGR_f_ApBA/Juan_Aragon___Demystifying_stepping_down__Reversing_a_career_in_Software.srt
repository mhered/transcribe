1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,920
So, welcome everyone back.

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,480
I hope you are full of energy and not really sleepy after the huge amount of food that I

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,440
can team with delivering. We have a really nice talk now. I am personally interested

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,920
in this because the topic I think it might be close to many people here. So, yeah, without

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:47,320
further ado, let's introduce Juan Aragon and maybe we can give it a hand.

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,080
Hello everyone. Thank you very much for coming. My name is Juan Aragon and I'm a software

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,160
engineer. I'm a software engineer. Is that okay? Cool. I'm a software engineer working

8
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,200
for a company called Bloomberg. I work for the document discovery group and my team,

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,880
we offer is a personal document platform that allows other application teams to build on

10
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,280
top of the features that we offer. We offer features like search, classification, storage,

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,920
and things like this, very generic. I've been working on that company for seven and a half

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,800
years and probably what is most relevant for this presentation is up until April this

13
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,800
year I was an engineer manager. I did that role for around three and a half years but

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,040
in April I decided to step down. So, today I'm here to talk to all of you about my own

15
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,560
career path, my own journey. I would like to illustrate that career in software can

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,040
be dynamic and flexible and hopefully I can show you that it's full of interesting avenues

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,920
to explore throughout your career. I would like, before I start, I would like to thank

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:10,120
all the organizers for giving me the opportunity to be here. Right. As I said, I work for a

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,600
company called Bloomberg and for those who don't know what we do, this will be a picture

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,160
of the Bloomberg terminal. Unfortunately, it's not very clear and what we offer is kind

21
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,480
of a software solution for investment for people who work in the markets that provides

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,880
real time market data, news, and analytics. The terminal is composed for different functions

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,680
or applications and if you could see the picture you will see different boxes. But in a way

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,040
they work independent. The people who are subscribed to the Bloomberg terminal are people

25
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,240
who are interested in real time market data from the stock exchange, you know, prices

26
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,880
from trade, prices from commodities, prices from bonds, anything that you can price in

27
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,520
the financial systems, you will get it from the Bloomberg terminal. You will also get

28
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,600
real time news as well as communication opportunities with all the people who use the Bloomberg

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,920
terminal. And just to finish with this, the subscribers that we have vary a lot. It can

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,280
be investment banks, it can be central banks, it can be regulators, governments. In all

31
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,760
broad is anything who has an interest on the financial capital markets. If you want to

32
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,640
know more about that, just let me know after the talk. Right, but going back to our agenda,

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,880
I divided the presentation in four different sections. The first one I would like to make

34
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,080
a disclaimer. Then we will talk about a common career path in software engineering and then

35
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,880
I will use my own career to deconstruct it in different stages, hopefully so that a career

36
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,000
can be flexible and dynamic. And then I will close with some conclusions. If you haven't

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,400
had your coffee, you can disconnect now and then I will wake you up when the conclusions

38
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,320
come. Right, so as a disclaimer, I wanted to say that this is not a career at buy stock.

39
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,520
Careers are way too personal. You know, they are very dependent on the individuals. There

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,400
are so many factors that can affect your career, your company, where you work, your culture,

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,360
the culture, your company, the opportunities that they might offer. So I cannot come here

42
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:26,200
and say, do these five things to have a successful career in software engineering. It's impossible

43
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,400
for me to give kind of a broad career advice that is applicable for all of you. Today I'm

44
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,480
going to talk about my own experience. You know, I don't really know if I have a successful

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,840
career. What I can tell you is I'm proud about the career I'm having and hopefully you will

46
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,320
find some of my experience inspiring or motivational for you in your careers.

47
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,680
Right, so talking about kind of the common career progression in the software industry,

48
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,480
I would like to introduce a topic that probably you are familiar with, but it's the career

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,920
ladder. It's very simple. It's a metaphor for job promotion. You start every step of

50
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,960
the ladder. It's a new job. It's a new promotion. It has different responsibilities, obligations,

51
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,960
different salary probably, but it's a singular track that will take you to the top. And in

52
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,560
theory, at the top, they are the greatest benefits as well as the greatest responsibilities,

53
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,360
obligations, authority, all these things. This concept is used in a lot of industries.

54
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,360
You might think about, for example, the Army, right? They implemented as a rank system.

55
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,200
It can be used as well in medicine, in nursing, in law, in law enforcement. And now I would

56
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,000
like to ask you something. Do you think that we use it in our industry, in software, hands

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,440
up food? Right? Maybe one third. This is my personal opinion. I think we use it, right?

58
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,840
When we talk about levels in our industry, it's basically the career ladder, right? You

59
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,400
go from one level to another. So why do we use it? It's because it gives a very well

60
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,760
structure for career progression, right? It defines the behaviors and the responsibilities

61
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,320
of every role. It simplifies a lot a career conversation. What should I do next? Well,

62
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,920
you just need to go to the next level, right? So it also defines very well what is required

63
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,360
to get to the next level and what is required for that level to stay in that level. And

64
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,880
here I would like to spend a little bit of time talking about performance review. Maybe

65
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,000
some of you in your companies do it differently, but most commonly, you know, big tech companies,

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,880
what they do is they go through performance cycles sometimes twice a year, sometimes once

67
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,360
a year. And if you are willing or if you would like to go to the next level, what you will

68
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,560
need to do is propose yourself for a career, for a promotion. You will get, you will evaluate

69
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,640
yourself. You will get your people in your team to evaluate you. So it will be peers

70
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,560
evaluation and you will be also evaluated by your manager. Then there will be a calibration

71
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,080
process that will check whether, you know, you satisfy the requirements to go to the

72
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,200
next level. And in that calibration, it will be depending by the, you know, the size of

73
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,240
the company and the different, you know, trees on the organization. And they will make sure

74
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,680
that all the promotion are coherent and there is no one group that they are promoting a

75
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,960
lot of people and another group is lagging behind. But enough about that. Now I would

76
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,080
like to talk about my own career in software. As you can see, there is, you can see, there

77
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,160
is an illustration of my career in software and as, yeah, you can see, as you can see,

78
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,720
it hasn't been always going linear as sending up, right? There will be moments that go down,

79
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,840
there will be moments that I will be going through more progression. But what is clear

80
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,040
is like, at least for me, every time I make a decision, there were multiple paths. So

81
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,800
what I would like to do now is go through different stages of this career and trying

82
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,880
to deconstruct it. I would like to introduce you to little Juan, he's the blue person there

83
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,600
and now he's going to go through the early stages of his career. Right. So at the very

84
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,360
beginning, there is always, you know, where does your career start? And pretty sure if

85
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,720
I ask you, like, when your career started, I will get the diverse answers, right? One

86
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,840
can be, my career started the first time I joined this company. Someone might say the

87
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,480
first time I started university, I decided I wanted to study computer science. Someone

88
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,800
can be like, I was working a completely different industry, I moved to this industry because

89
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,040
I did a bootcamp and in that day, you know, I think that my career started. In my case,

90
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,920
it was when I decided to study abroad. That year, I was, I went through a cultural exchange,

91
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,640
I was influenced by new people, you know, I met a lot of people and that day, I mean,

92
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,640
that year I decided that I wanted to work abroad. Probably if I would have come back

93
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,080
to Spain, my country, my country of origin, my career would have been completely different.

94
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,640
So that's why I think that moment in time, it was what it completely influenced my career.

95
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,440
Also at the beginning, to know if there are a lot of people who are at the various stage

96
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,120
of their career, but we worry a lot about our CV and how we are portrayed on our CV.

97
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,000
What I wanted to say is that sometimes we give too much importance to the CV and what

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,040
is most important is, you know, the CV can be something that will open, give you the

99
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,840
chance to do an interview, but at the end of the day, it depends on your skills and

100
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,920
whether, you know, you are a good fit for that company. And probably what is most important

101
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,120
is if that company is a good fit for you, sometimes we forget about that. Then I joined

102
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,560
a small company. They were doing embedded software for pagers. Maybe some people don't

103
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,880
know what is a pager. But, yeah, in that company, you know, we were a few engineers.

104
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,520
And, you know, I went through a process of exploration and discovery. I didn't really

105
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,160
know what I liked, but, you know, they gave me the opportunity and I wanted to start my

106
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,280
career. But quickly, you know, I discovered that that was in the place for me. I wanted

107
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,400
to try something different and I was kind of head-handed to a startup in London. In

108
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,160
that startup, some of you might have worked in a startup, you know, you get a lot of kind

109
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,720
of an exponential growth, right? You do a lot of things, you can learn a lot of things

110
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,200
and you can, you know, grow very quickly. And that will lead to the first time I stepped

111
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:50,960
down. So I was working in that startup. I'm going to drink a little bit of water. Right.

112
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,400
So I was working for that startup for around two years. And then, again, I decided that

113
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,760
I wanted to do something different. I wanted to work for maybe a company who will offer

114
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,080
more structure, you know, different processes where I will, you know, be involved with different

115
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:20,200
people. And I decided to apply to Bloomberg, senior software engineer position. And, you

116
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,240
know, at that time I was a lead developer. I was leading a team of two. And, you know,

117
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,320
I was the lead developer of the BlackBerry application. Again, you know, that time BlackBerry

118
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:41,440
was market lead. Again, I'm old. But anyway, you know, I interviewed with them and I didn't

119
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,480
go prepared, right? I was thinking like, you know, I'm having a very good career, exponential

120
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,200
growth, you know, I will do amazing. But that wasn't the reality. I completely, that was

121
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,240
a terrible interview. I feel shame on it. But that showed me a few things. First thing

122
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,560
it was like, I really like how they treat me, even though, you know, it was a completely

123
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,200
terrible interview. They treat me with a lot of respect. I really like what I saw, you

124
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,000
know, so that kind of lead me to, okay, maybe I want to work for this company. These values,

125
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,600
I like them. They can be a good fit. So also that helped me to be a little bit more humble,

126
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,560
right? If I want to get a career move, if I want to do something, also it's on me, you

127
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,560
know, to deliver it. So a few months later, I applied again, but this time I applied for

128
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,080
the graduate position, for the junior position. I got the job, and I was very happy. But,

129
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,160
you know, that kind of kind of be seen like a stepping down, right? I went from being

130
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,400
a lead developer to be a junior developer, right? I started at the same time as people

131
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,760
who graduated in university and things like this. But in my case, and throughout my career,

132
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,160
I've been doing this. I analyzed the risk and the opportunity. That time, you know, the

133
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,280
risk, what was the risk? Like, moving to that company, if I don't like it, maybe I can find

134
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,920
something else. But I saw, you know, and the opportunity is that I saw, it's like, okay,

135
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,960
it's a big corporation, probably will give me better job security, better career paths,

136
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:09,880
and then I decided to give it a go. And that's what leads Little Juan to the next stage on

137
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:18,280
his career, that is the path to becoming an experience engineer. So when I started Bloomberg,

138
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:24,440
I, I mean, through my whole career, I always liked to explore, you know, to try to find

139
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,120
different things, pushing myself into this comfort zone. And this is something that I

140
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,000
like to do, but considering like a achievable challenge, right? I will not push myself into

141
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,160
a position where I think I'm not going to be able to succeed. Today's a good example.

142
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,720
It's the first time I'm presenting in a conference, right? I'm completely out of my comfort zone.

143
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,360
I don't like speaking in public. So, but again, you know, I think that this will provide me

144
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,280
certain skills that can be useful for the future and will let me to grow and learn. Another

145
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,000
thing that I've done during this phase of becoming an experience engineer, it was role

146
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,480
switching. But role switching, I don't mean moving from job to job. I mean, like, you know,

147
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,960
in engineering, we have different roles. You might be doing a little bit more front end,

148
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,880
more back end, more DevOps. So during my career, I've been always trying different things,

149
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,760
right? Also, you know, being like kind of a just person. When my manager came to me and

150
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,600
told me, well, this thing has a closed deadline, will you mind going there and spend a few months

151
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,800
and helping them meet in that deadline? I was always super keen to do those things because

152
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,960
I could always see the opportunity meeting new people, meeting, I mean, working in a different

153
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,960
stack, meeting new managers, spending my network and things like this. So that helped me to learn

154
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:49,960
and grow and do small steps towards maturity or experience engineer. So during that path,

155
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:56,480
you will do mistakes, you will fail, that's guaranteed. But what is not guaranteed is we

156
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,040
learn from that failure, right? It's very important to experience something even if you fail. Next

157
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,840
time when you will have something, you will experience something similar, probably you will

158
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,960
do something different and that will not guarantee that you will succeed, but at least you are not

159
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,640
going to make the same mistake that you made before. And that's how you grow. You will also be

160
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,280
gaining more responsibility, you know, you will be an ally of your manager. What you are going to

161
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:29,360
do is like taking away job or work from them and you will be mentoring people, you will be kind

162
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,880
of the reference when they are not around and you will increase your impact, right? You will

163
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,480
proactively think better. You will identify areas of your team that can be improved, could be in

164
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,240
the tech side, it could be in communication, it could be in anything. And probably you will be the

165
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,680
person to go when large projects has to be delivered, you know, that have dependencies in

166
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,080
other teams and things like this. I think that moment is when you are experienced of where

167
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:04,080
you are an engineer, a mature software engineer. The next stage is when I became an engineer

168
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,640
manager. So there is something that I haven't mentioned during the whole presentation and it's

169
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,480
like, you know, I'm portraying that your career is just owned by you. That's not true, that's

170
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,960
completely true. There is always, you know, the other side, the company that you work for, the

171
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,680
people that has to rent you, your career partners, right? And that's something that you have less

172
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,840
control over. You can make changes but you don't know what you are going to encounter in the next

173
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,960
step. So your career partners, I like to define it as your support network. This support network

174
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,000
will be friends, family, you know, people who you talk to them about your career, who might be in

175
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,280
similar case to you and you can receive advice. Very important as well are your career and coaches.

176
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:57,320
These are the people around you, close to you, at your company that can give you advice, that can,

177
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,320
you know, put you in a situation that will make you grow your skills. And some of them in the

178
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,480
future will become your own sponsors, you know. Your sponsors will be the people who trust you

179
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:16,360
100%. They know that you can deliver and they will directly put you in opportunities. Something I

180
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,360
want to mention as well is once you think about a career move, you have to be very honest with

181
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:29,320
yourself. First, receive honest feedback from your career partners but also think whether, you

182
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,520
know, that move is going to be good for you and whether you have the skill set that is needed

183
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,280
for that career move. Sometimes we can get to focus on, I want to become this but look at yourself,

184
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,800
reflect, are you really ready to do that step? Maybe you have to look at some skills that you

185
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,720
have to build before you make that step. And linking with that skill set, I wanted to talk about

186
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,520
the skill set that I had to develop and I still developed what I was an engineering manager to

187
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,720
be a good engineering manager. And this might differ from company to company. Probably you will

188
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,720
see some commonalities with your companies. But one of the things is to understand the tech domain

189
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,440
and the business domain. You will be dealing with stakeholders on the tech side, you will be dealing

190
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,360
with stakeholders on the product and you will need to communicate very well with them. You know,

191
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,000
there will be people who are not technically strong that you have to explain very complicated

192
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,280
technical issues, you know, in a way that they can understand. At the same time, you will be the

193
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,040
leader of the team. So you will be the one who needs to dominate different communication styles.

194
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,760
There might be people that, you know, they are more introverted and you will need to know how to

195
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,960
talk to them. There might be people who are more extroverted and things like this or people who

196
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:51,080
directly prefer just to talk by mail or things like that. So at the same, what I wanted to say is

197
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:59,800
like you as a manager are the person who has to adapt their communication style. Oops. You will

198
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,920
also continue being a mentor. Probably if you became an engineering manager, you have been a

199
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,360
mentor throughout career based on something that you will continue fostering in your team. You must

200
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,640
have a growth mindset. You need to think what is next for your team all the time. You need to be

201
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,080
seeking opportunities for your team all the time and having a strong vision on how, you know,

202
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,240
your team is going to go in the next few years. It should be very good at giving feedback and also

203
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:33,840
receiving feedback. It's very important to be, to give direct constructive and sometimes negative

204
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,720
feedback to the people of your team. You know, it's part of the trust process and they will, you

205
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,720
know, if you build that kind of feedback loop with them, you know, they will appreciate it a lot.

206
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,480
Right. So the next thing will be, you know, sometimes when you are an engineering manager,

207
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:58,320
you might have an impact greater than your team. So you might contribute some initiatives that

208
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,920
they are in the department, company-wide, things like this. But probably what is the most important

209
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,720
one of the core roles of an engineering manager will be embracing change. It is guaranteed that

210
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,160
there will be uncertain times for your team. It can be that the project that the whole team is

211
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,840
working is cancelled. You know, it can be that you have been moved to another company, another

212
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,520
company has acquired you and your department is gone. But you will need to be the shield that will

213
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,480
protect your whole team for that. You will need to show them that there is opportunity ahead of them.

214
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,480
And you know, and if we keep together, we can go through this uncertain time. Last thing is to

215
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,360
foster trust, right? It's very important not only that the team can trust you, but the team members

216
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,680
between each other can trust each other. That will make them much more effective and efficient.

217
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,680
And last thing, sorry, is to demonstrate good judgment. There will be moments, no matter how you

218
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,120
set up your team, that consensus is not going to be built. And you are going to be the person who

219
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:05,920
will need to make the decision. Cool. And that will lead me to Little Juan to be in the stage

220
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,920
where I am now that is returning to being an individual contributor. As I said during the

221
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:19,800
introduction, right, I was an engineering manager and in April I became a remote individual

222
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:27,640
contributor. And we have been looking at these kind of paths during the whole presentation.

223
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,240
This looks to me like two axes, right? The Y is kind of your position and the X is kind of time.

224
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,200
But you know, there are so many factors that can influence your career. It's not only what

225
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,280
position you hold. It's also your family, your friends, where you live, your commute to work,

226
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,560
you know, like the hours that you put in the office, whether you like your manager or not,

227
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,840
all these things. So if we think about all these things and combine them together, you know,

228
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,840
and I put all these things, my career will look something like this, right? So that blue line

229
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,800
will be a combination of all the factors that affect my career. So if we go back, you know,

230
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,000
I started, was working for that as a small company doing embedded software. And then, you know,

231
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,520
it felt like a little bit small for me, so that will kind of affect my motivation. Then I moved

232
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,240
to another startup, to a startup, and then I went through an exponential phase. I was very happy,

233
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,960
but you know, I wanted more job security. I wanted to experience something different. And then it

234
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,480
was when, you know, I went to Bloomberg and that kind of steady build, you know, my path to

235
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,560
engineering manager. But as you can see, when I became an engineering manager, things started

236
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:46,680
going down. You know, I was, me and my family, we were affected by the pandemic. And it was tough

237
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,280
years, right? Even though my performance at work didn't, wasn't affected. But, you know,

238
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,840
my mental health, my family, you know, it was very hard for us to live abroad and having people,

239
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,920
the people that were very important for us, you know, very far. So then I started to affect my,

240
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,960
my personal life and, you know, in general, my career. So that's the deep that you see. At that

241
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,720
point, you know, I decided to talk to my manager and told them, like, you know, I would like to

242
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,960
move back to my country. I would like to move back to Spain. They were very supportive and they

243
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,800
gave me the opportunity to work from here remotely. The only thing is I cannot be an engineering

244
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,640
manager while my whole team is located in London and go to the office and all these things. So I

245
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:36,080
took the opportunity. But obviously, this is not going to make this last stage to step up that

246
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,960
quickly, right? So as every career moved, when this happened, I was very motivated because it was a

247
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,160
new set of opportunities for me. Why? Because I will be able to pioneer change, right? We are only,

248
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,880
I don't know, like a hundred people in the whole company who are working remotely. So I will be

249
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,640
able to influence a cultural change inside a company that predominantly work, you know,

250
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,200
co-located to show them that we can be, you know, effective working remotely from different

251
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,120
locations. I can use my experience as an engineering manager to be a better individual

252
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,840
contributor. And I will try to, you know, influence that culture change in the company. It's a big

253
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:26,400
challenge, but I like it. Some conclusions for those who, you know, were sleeping until now. Wake

254
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,560
up, please. So I would like to say that, you know, career-side dynamic and flexible. You always

255
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,120
have a lot of different paths, opportunities to do. We, I think we are all very lucky to be in such a

256
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:48,120
dynamic industry. And we have to take advantage of that. The next thing is stepping down or career

257
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,160
moves can boost your career. Every time I stepped down, it was a big motivational factor for me

258
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:02,280
that helped me to grow and learn more. Next thing is if we put things into perspective, your career

259
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,560
is one-eighth of your life. It's an important part of it, but there are so many things that can

260
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:13,440
affect your career. So not everything can be your career. And last thing is be honest about yourself

261
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,800
and what you value the most. In my case, there were these two little goals that have made me be at

262
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,840
the top of my career. Thank you very much. And if you have any questions, I will gladly answer them.

263
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:33,440
Thank you very much, Juan. That was a really, really cool talk. We have time for some questions.

264
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,760
Do you have one? Okay. Thank you very much. That was an excellent talk. I was wondering whether

265
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:47,160
you faced any negative judgments or negative perceptions about what can be perceived as a step

266
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:56,960
down within your career? I think it's a little bit more personal, not from outside. I remember when

267
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:05,000
I joined Bloomberg, at the same time, I was feeling like, is this the right move? Everyone around me

268
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,400
is much younger than me. And I was feeling at the beginning a little bit out of place. So it was more

269
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,400
like personal misconceptions rather than from the outside. And I think those are hard to fix.

270
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:34,680
Thank you. I'm curious that you presented like going from an engineer manager to IC as a

271
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:41,600
stepping down. Whereas I think this can be demotivating for some people saying, okay, I go to a

272
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,280
lower level. Also the pay perhaps can be lower. So it can be difficult for people. What I'm seeing

273
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:55,360
more often is having two tracks, an engineer manager and IC, and being able to be useful for the

274
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,920
company at the same level, but in a different way. So what do you think about this split? This is

275
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,800
something that you think can be useful for helping people, not seeing changing roles as something

276
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:20,120
bad like you're getting worse? Yeah, that's the whole point of the presentation. This is not such a

277
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:27,080
thing like stepping down. It's your own perception. For me, going to being an IC now, I see a career

278
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,840
promotion to be honest. I'm much more happy. I'm going to do things that I haven't been doing in the

279
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,200
last few years. I will be in an environment that will help me to continue learning and growing.

280
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,720
You put all these things into balance and then you make your own decision. Maybe for some people

281
00:27:43,720 --> 00:28:09,200
it might be like stepping down. For me, it wasn't. And we have another question here. What advice could you give to somebody that has changed of career that comes from a different area?

282
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:38,200
How do you manage the reaction from looking at a job? So I think when someone, I don't know, like doing a bootcamp and change career and go to engineering, they come with a lot of value. Sometimes for the teams to diversify them, it's very important to have someone who has changed their job.

283
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:57,200
It's important to have someone who thinks a little bit different or who can have a different opinion. So I think you can find the advantage for that. With rejection, I think when you go through a career change or an industry change, you need to target very well where you want to work.

Because there will be companies that value a lot what you bring, but there will be other companies that they will be much more focused on, I just want this technology. So try to do your research and select those companies who really value what you can bring to them.

285
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:34,200
And we have another question here. Hello. I want to ask you, what do you think you step down in part of your life? I think you never step down because every day you stay learning and going up and growth and...

286
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:53,200
I think you never step down. Thank you. That's the point of the presentation, right? You think as me, but there might be people who think otherwise. There are some industries that are so focused on where you are at, what is your job position.

287
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Actually, Pablo was helping me with the presentation and we kind of have a joke with these new career titles that there are like software craftsman level 35 and he's like, okay, what does that mean? At the end of the day, we are all software engineers.

288
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,200
The fact that you have that job title doesn't mean much to me. Maybe for them they do.

289
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I miss one part, the money part, because the title is like, yeah, this is my badge and something that you could be defined by that, but the reality is most of us, or at least if not all, we work for money.

290
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:47,200
That's another step if you step up or step down and you could get to a lead engineer in a small company and jump to a big company and the wages are pretty different. What are more or less the question is, can you get more context about it?

291
00:30:47,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Money is one of the values that you will combine for the blue light. I can tell you that both times I step down, my salary was cut and that's something that you are willing to do. If you think that that will help you to continue going up, that's your own decision.

292
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:18,200
But yeah, it's what you value. If you value money the most, you know.

293
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Yeah, we didn't money. That's the conclusion. I think that we are running out of time. I'm pretty sure that many of you already have maybe most questions, so maybe you want to catch one around the conference and maybe ask other questions that maybe you were too afraid to ask. So thank you very much.
